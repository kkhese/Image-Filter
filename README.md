Q1: Code for applying FFT to Images

Q2: Fourier spectrums for Images

    a. Spectrum into a set of rings
    
    b. Spectrum into angualr sectors
    
Q3: Three different types of Low pass & High pass filters for Images
    
    - Butterworth filter
    
    - Gaussian filter
    
    - Ideal filter

Filtered images were saved as png format
